# Java-Beginner-Project-9
Beginner project completed during my Master's program. 
This program uses the subclass BetterRectangle that provides a getPerimeter and getArea methods to compute the 
area and perimeter of a rectangle. The Rectangle class of the standard Java library does not supply a method to comÂ­
pute the area or the perimeter of a rectangle. The program prompts the user for the coordinates of x and y
then prompts the user for the width and height of the rectangle and return the area and perimeter of it.
